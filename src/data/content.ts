    title: "About CampusGem",
    description: "As a young person growing up in the twenty-first century, I became aware of how contaminated society is with various forms of information meant to stimulate our thoughts. Because of the abundance of contaminated content available, we unconsciously have a tendency to act in certain ways. This is a serious issue since incorrect conventions and ideas, as well as media and entertainment content, are ingraining themselves into our lives. The mind is where change starts. With the help of the Holy Spirit, we hope to ignite a transformational movement that will instill Christ-centered values in the minds of young people and future generations.",
